# Changelog

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-24

### Features

- Add a `/speakers` page listing every speaker with the sessions they give,
  linked from the nav (EN: "Speakers", ES: "Ponentes")
- Every session now shows a level (beginner/intermediate/advanced) as a badge
  next to the track on the session detail page and inline in the schedule
  timeline

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-24

### Bug Fixes

- Sessions detail page: survive an empty sessions table at build time (Cache
  Components rejects an empty `generateStaticParams` array; a fresh
  Production database has no rows until migrations are applied)

### Maintenance

- Consistent qa-ref/prod-ref naming in the setup guide, fix the Vercel
  first-deploy steps, add the Repository access screenshot
- Walkthrough: non-deterministic phase reports, changelog diff step
- Add the licenses: MIT for the code, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for `docs/` and `.claude/`
- Use the workshop title in the README
- Release-manager walkthrough: every step from the start prompt to the finished
  release, CI on a fork, the migrations list fallback
- Remove the draft markers from both walkthroughs
- Keep only the slides PDF in `docs/presentation`
